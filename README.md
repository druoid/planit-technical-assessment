## Purpose

This project showcases playwright UI automation examples for the planit technical assessment exercise.

The project uses github actions and Page Object Model best practices. It also uses eslint as the linting tool and faker
for dynamic data creation. An es-lint report and playwright report are uploaded as artifacts when the git actions pipeline is run.

## Getting the Latest Code

To get the latest code open your IDE terminal and navigate to where you would like the project to reside (usually a dev folder) and run `https://github.com/druoid/planit-technical-assessment.git`

## Setting Up the Environment

To run playwright tests locally, your system must have node installed

2. Restart terminal, then install Node.js by running the following command `nvm install node` # latest version
3. Verify npm is installed by running the following command `npm -v` # Should return the npm version

## Running the Tests
